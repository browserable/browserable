Browserable is an open-source and self-hostable JS library (MIT license) for building agents that can execute web tasks - https://github.com/browserable/browserable.

It allows you to build browser agents that can navigate sites, fill out forms, and extract information, track status and fetch results. It is currently at 90.4% on the Web Voyager benchmark.

With this library, you can:
- Run a browser agent suite in your local machine with one single command- `npx browserable`
- Integrate into existing code with REST APIs/ SDKs
- Self-host the browser agent and scale without being tied to any single browser/ browser infrastructure/ LLM provider.

```bash
npx browserable
```
