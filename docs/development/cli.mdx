## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues while running the commands:

1. **Missing Dependencies**
   - For Docker: Visit https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/
   - For Docker Compose: Visit https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/
   - For Node.js and npm: Visit https://nodejs.org/en/download

2. **Port Conflicts**
   Make sure none of the required ports (2001-2003, 8000, 3300, 9001) are being used by other applications.

3. **Docker Issues**
   If Docker containers fail to start, try running `browserable down` first, then retry the start command.
