## API Keys Management

The API keys section of the admin interface allows you to manage authentication credentials for various services.

**Note**: If you haven't set the LLM API keys Or Browser API keys in the docker-compose/.env files, then you can add them directly via the admin UI. If you've added them via the environment keys, then you wouldn't see the LLM API key and Browser API key forms in the Admin UI as the env variables override the UI settings.

### Current Access

You can access the API keys management interface at:
```
http://localhost:2001/dash/@admin/settings
```
